## About 'LTA'
LiTTle Angle is a nickname of my friend(Well, maybe it **was**). Any way, now I'll call my projects LTA. Why? Because I think they are fun.  
However, different from my good friend. These(Maybe only just 'this' at date 2020.3.31) projects is going to be totally useless, though my dream once was to build a pack of powerful softwares(But, I am too young and too simple). 
Thus, these projects will end with a great deal of bugs or something else at a very high chence. Who cares?
