## About 'LTA'
LiTTle Angle is a nickname of my friend(Well, maybe it **was**). Any way, now I'll call my projects LTA. Why? Because I think they are fun.  
However, different from my good friend. These(Maybe only just 'this' at **date 2020.3.31**) projects is going to be totally useless, though my dream once was to build a pack of powerful softwares(But, I am too young and too simple). 
Thus, these projects will end with a great deal of bugs or something else at a very high chence. Who cares?

## And About The Shoes
Well, maybe ~~most~~ (**all**, that should be my goal) of my code (in *LTA*) will be written in ruby mostly with shoes (a great framework written by \_why though it has been abandoned, it can be found at https://github.com/shoes/shoes3). That's all. **date: 2020.8.29**
